   2 Warning CDFG-468    Output port is wider than connected signal.        
                         This may cause simulation mismatches between the   
                         original and synthesized designs.                  
   6 Warning CDFG-508    Removing unused register.                          
                         A flip-flop or latch that was inferred for an      
                         unused signal or variable was removed. Use         
                         '::legacy::set_attribute                           
                         hdl_preserve_unused_registers true /' to preserve  
                         the flip-flop or latch.

   2 Warning ELABUTL-123 Undriven module output port.                       
                         Use the 'hdl_undriven_output_port_value'           
                         attribute to control treatment of undriven output  
                         port during elaboration.                           
   4   Info  GLO-34      Deleting instances not driving any primary         
                         outputs.                                           
                         Optimizations such as constant propagation or      
                         redundancy removal could change the connections    
                         so a hierarchical instance does not drive any      
                         primary outputs anymore. To see the list of        
                         deleted hierarchical instances, set the            
                         'information_level' attribute to 2 or above. If    
                         message is truncated set message attribute         
                         'truncate' to false to see the complete list. To   
                         prevent this optimization, set the

  20 Warning LBR-9       Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                         Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                         library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                         marked as unusable and as timing model.
