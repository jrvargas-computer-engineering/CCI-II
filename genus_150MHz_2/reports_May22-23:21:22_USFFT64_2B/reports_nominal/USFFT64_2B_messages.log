  20 Warning LBR-101  Unusable clock gating integrated cell.             
                      To use the cell in clock gating, Set cell          
                      attribute 'dont_use' false in the library.         
   1   Info  LBR-109  Set default library domain.                        
   2   Info  LBR-412  Created nominal operating condition.               
                      The nominal operating condition represents either  
                      the nominal PVT values if specified in the         
                      library source, or the default PVT values (1.0,    
                      1.0, 1.0).                                         
  20 Warning LBR-43   Libcell has no area attribute.  Defaulting to 0    
                      area.                                              
                      Specify a valid area value for the libcell.        
  20 Warning LBR-9    Library cell has no output pins defined.           
                      Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the     
                      library. Otherwise, the library cell will be       
                      marked as unusable and as timing model.            
   2 Warning PHYS-103 Marking library cell 'avoid'.                      
                      To prevent the library cell from being set to      
                      'avoid', set attribute                             
                      'lib_lef_consistency_check_enable' to 'false'.     
 138 Warning PHYS-125 Cannot add power pin to a library cell that is     
                      currently instantiated in a netlist.               
 138 Warning PHYS-126 Cannot add ground pin to a library cell that is    
                      currently instantiated in a netlist.               
2067 Warning PHYS-128 Library cell pin 'use' attribute is inconsistent   
                      between lib and LEF.                               
                      Overriding lib value with LEF value. To use .lib   
                      as golden do: '::legacy::set_attribute             
                      use_power_ground_pin_from_lef false'.              
   1 Warning TIM-11   Possible timing problems have been detected in     
                      this design.                                       
                      Use 'report timing -lint' for more information.
