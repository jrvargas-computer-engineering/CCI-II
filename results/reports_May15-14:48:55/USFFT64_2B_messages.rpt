   5   Info  CDFG-250    Processing multi-dimensional arrays.               
   2   Info  CDFG-361    Signal is not referenced within the process or     
                         block, but is in the sensitivity list.             
                         Asynchronous logic, such as a latch or             
                         combinational logic, is inferred for this process  
                         or block. Signals that are not referenced can be   
                         removed from the sensitivity list. If the intent   
                         is to infer a flip-flop, ensure that the process   
                         or block is sensitive to the signal edge by        
                         adding 'posedge' or 'negedge' for Verilog designs  
                         or 'event' for VHDL designs.

   2 Warning CDFG-468    Output port is wider than connected signal.        
                         This may cause simulation mismatches between the   
                         original and synthesized designs.                  
   3   Info  CDFG-500    Unused module input port.

                         the design.

                         unused signal or variable was removed. Use

                         the flip-flop or latch.
