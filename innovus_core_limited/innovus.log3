Project Initialization
Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 180nm process node: total_c_th=5, relative_c_th=0.03 and coupling_c_th=3.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including tQuantus, IQRC and Quantus QRC extraction.
	For postRoute effortLevel low extraction, the coupling_c_th value will be used only when the -capFilterMode parameter of the setExtractRCMode command is set to relAndCoup or relOrCoup. Default value of -capFilterMode parameter in postRoute extraction effortLevel low is relOnly.
	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'standard'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode is 'low'.
Updating process node dependent CCOpt properties for the 180nm process node.

**ERROR: (IMPCCOPT-1146):	Clock tree clk cannot use the following cells.
  CTS will not be able to run on this clock tree.
ICF is cant_use for the following reasons: missing time lib data.  This affects the following instances: u_ring/PAD_CLK/PAD
Please load time libs for those cells missing time lib data. If you have set this to be a stop pin using 'set_db pin:<pin> .cts_sink_type stop', but have omitted to specify caps using 'set_db pin:<pin> .cts_capacitance_override -index {delay_corner <DC>} <value>' for ALL delay corners, you will also see this error.

Validating CTS configuration done.
