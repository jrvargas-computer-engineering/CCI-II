Project Initialization
Applying the recommended capacitance filtering threshold values for 180nm process node: total_c_th=5, relative_c_th=0.03 and coupling_c_th=3.
	These values will be used by all post-route extraction engines, including tQuantus, IQRC and Quantus QRC extraction.
	For postRoute effortLevel low extraction, the coupling_c_th value will be used only when the -capFilterMode parameter of the setExtractRCMode command is set to relAndCoup or relOrCoup. Default value of -capFilterMode parameter in postRoute extraction effortLevel low is relOnly.
	The accuracy mode for postRoute effortLevel low extraction will be set to 'standard'.
	Default value for EffortLevel(-effortLevel option of the setExtractRCMode) in postRoute extraction mode is 'low'.
Updating process node dependent CCOpt properties for the 180nm process node.
